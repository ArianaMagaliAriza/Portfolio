# Portfolio ðŸ’¼
Hi! This is a personal blog that I made to put in practise some Front-End skills such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and some Javascript.<br>
I have used Bootstrap to make the web responsive and used flex box to make a multi language menu (ENG/ESP).<br>
I'm still making some changes from time to time while I'm learning.
